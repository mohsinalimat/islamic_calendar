# Islamic Hijri Calendar


## Goal

* Convert gregorian calendar dates to the lunar calendar muslims follow
    - Gregorian and hijri date should be shown together
    - Current date in both formats should be displayed clearly
    - Create an algorithm, so users can view any dates in the past and future in gregorian and hijri date format
    
* Allow users to create a reminder that they can set from current to future dates
    - Notify users an hour before the reminder was set
    
* Notify users daily of the current date in gregorian and hijri format

* Allow users to search for all islamic events taking place this year
