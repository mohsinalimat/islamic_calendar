# Islamic Hijri Calendar

This lightweight app uses an algorithmic approach to accurately calculate past, present and future islamic dates. It searches for when significant islamic events will take place and what date it will be held in Gregorian and Hijri format. The app will notify users when their is an important event.

## Goal

* Convert gregorian calendar dates to the lunar calendar muslims follow
    - Gregorian and hijri date should be shown together
    - Current date in both formats should be displayed clearly
    - Create an algorithm, so users can view any dates in the past and future in gregorian and hijri date format
    
* Allow users to create a reminder that they can set from current to future dates
    - Notify users an hour before the reminder was set
    
* Notify users daily of the current date in gregorian and hijri format

* Allow users to search for all islamic events taking place this year
